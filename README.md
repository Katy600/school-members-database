# school-members-database
Build a demo that allows someone to add a new member with the fields “Name”, “Email Address” and "School" (selected from a list). The demo should display all members for a selected school.
The ToucanTech database stores information about its members. Each member can be associated with 1 or more school.

You may use any freely available programming language and modules (although be aware that the primary language we use is PHP). We will want to run and connect to your code on our own machines so if there are any unusual pre-requisites please document them.

### Install
